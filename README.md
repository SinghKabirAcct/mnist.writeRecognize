# mnist.writeRecognize

In This project, I hope to create a platform in which users can enter handwritten digits through their touchpad or mouse and then have Keras ML interpret their written digits!

Progress:
 - Canvas has been set up
 - Drawing capabilities have been set up
 - snapshot capabilities have been set up

How-To-Use:
 - Hold down your touchpad or right-click your mouse and move it to draw, release to stop drawing
 - Press any key on your keyboard to take a snapshot of your canvas and have it opened in a new tab
